Mapping in Hibernate

Current scenario laptop is embedded in user table.
The laptop is an object itself and it should have it's own table instead of being embedded to user table
Also a user can have more than one laptop this would create redundant data

so we can create a user table and a laptop table
laptop table needs it's own primary key so let's add Lid
so to map the laptop with user we will add a foreign key in user

in user we add primary key of laptop
1 to 1 relationship --> 1 user has 1 laptop

but here we have
1 to many from users perspective ie a user can have more than 1 laptop
and
many to 1 from laptops perspective ie multiple laptops can be owned by a user

so if we want to map both the tables we should use add a foreign key of user table to laptop table, because if a user has more than 1 laptop it will again have multiple rows with same user id but if we add the foreign key in laptop table then only 1 laptop record will be there

there is one more option to create a new table user_laptop table where for every user id a laptop id is assigned however in case on many to many adding column to either table won't work hence in such cases we need to create a new table
